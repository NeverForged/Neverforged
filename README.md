#Neverforged
Neverforged is a table top role playing game I've been developing in my spare time for the last few years.

## Dice.py
The Dice class is a dice roller for the game I'm writing.  The reason i'm sharing it is that it creates a dice rolling space in MatPlotLib with clickable explodes/rerolls.  The actual method is tied into the game I'm writing; however the work I did getting the image to show and reroll I don't mind sharing.  If there is demand for it, I could make a general dice roller out of it.
