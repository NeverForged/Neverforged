The Plague Hunters, or Shulie Brotherhood, are a remnant of an old Imperial unit, designated to fight the Pestilent wherever they arose.  While they were well respected in the old empire, and even in the early Church when the Church took them over, today they are a memory and a collection of abandoned castles throughout the land.  But when the Plague came back after a 400-year hiatus, the rulers of the Corvish Island nations have been scouring the prisons, recruiting among the peasantry, and even asking the noble families for volunteers.  
<br>Are you a volunteer?  A prisoner that was sentenced to the Hunters?  An Alchemist that wants to use the outbreak for study?  A sorcerer that joined to avoid being hunted by the Linghun Inquisition or Templars?  A noble who was forced to volunteer to give up his lands and titles (or a claim thereof, if your parents still hold the title)?
